Agriculture is one of the major applications of rapidly evolving multispectral Unmanned Aerial Remote Sensing. It provides an opportunity to observe and analysis the crop health at a much higher spatial scale in comparison to satellite enabled observations.
The current research focuses on developing an open source python based tool for calculating NDVI, GNDVI & SAVI for high resolution multi spectral UAV imagery. An interactive user interface provides an easy to execute crop health assessment framework for both the technical and non technical users practicing the unmanned technology in agriculture. 
Besides generating NDVI images, developed tool set provides some of the major statistical measures for preprocessing the multispectral UAV imagery and to generate the different interpretation regarding the crop health.
